    "Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It represents a specific, tangible entity in the real world that can be uniquely identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of class and object with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Class:\n",
    "A class is a template or blueprint for creating objects.\n",
    "It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that characterize objects of that class.\n",
    "It encapsulates data and behavior into a single unit.\n",
    "Class defines the common structure and behavior that objects of that type will exhibit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object:\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "It is a concrete realization of the class blueprint.\n",
    "Objects have their own unique data and can perform actions defined by the class methods.\n",
    "Objects can interact with each other through method calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Let's consider a class \"Car\" as an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",

    "Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It hides the internal state of an object and restricts access to it, allowing interaction with the object only through well-defined interfaces (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the process of simplifying complex systems by hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the essential features of an object. It allows the creation of abstract data types that can be used to model real-world entities in a more manageable and understandable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass). It promotes code reusability by allowing subclasses to extend or modify the functionality of their superclass. It facilitates the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes, leading to a more organized and modular codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects to take on multiple forms or behaviors depending on the context in which they are used. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling code to be written that can operate on objects of various types without knowing their specific class. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism)."

    "Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __init__() function in Python is a special method (also known as a constructor) that is automatically called when a new instance of a class is created. It initializes the object's attributes and performs any necessary setup tasks. The primary purpose of the __init__() function is to ensure that the object is properly initialized and ready for use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose of __init__() function:\n",
    "Initializing Object State: It allows you to initialize the initial state (attributes) of an object with default values or values provided by the user during object creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting Up Object: It provides an opportunity to perform any setup tasks or computations that need to be done when an object is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameterized Initialization: It allows the class to accept parameters during object instantiation, enabling customization of object properties.\n",

    "Let's consider a class Person with attributes name and age. We'll use the __init__() function to initialize these attributes during object creation:\n",

    "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), self is a special parameter that refers to the instance of the class. It is used within class methods to access and modify attributes and methods of the object (instance) itself. The use of self is crucial for proper functioning of class methods and for maintaining the state of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why self is used in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Accessing Attributes and Methods: Within a class method, self allows you to access the attributes and methods of the object (instance) to which the method belongs. Without self, you wouldn't be able to differentiate between instance variables and local variables within the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Referencing the Current Instance: self explicitly refers to the current instance of the class. When you call a method on an object (obj.method()), Python automatically passes the instance (obj) as the first argument to the method. This allows the method to operate on the specific instance that invoked it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Instance-specific Operations: Since each instance of a class can have its own set of attributes with potentially different values, self is used to refer to these attributes and perform operations specific to each instance. It ensures that modifications made to one instance do not affect other instances of the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Method Invocation: When you call a method on an object (obj.method()), Python internally translates this into a call to the corresponding method of the class, passing the instance as the first argument (self). This allows the method to operate on the data associated with that specific instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, self is used in OOP to differentiate instance attributes and methods from local variables, to reference the current instance, and to enable instance-specific operations within class methods. It is a fundamental concept in Python's object-oriented programming model."

    "Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class (superclass or base class). This enables code reuse, promotes modularity, and facilitates the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of inheritance in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, a subclass inherits from only one superclass. This is the most common type of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dog inherits from Animal\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "dog.speak()  # Output: Animal speaks\n",
    "dog.bark()   # Output: Dog barks\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Multiple Inheritance: In multiple inheritance, a subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. This allows the subclass to inherit attributes and methods from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class A:\n",
    "    def method_a(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Method A\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class B:\n",
    "    def method_b(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Method B\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class C(A, B):  # C inherits from both A and B\n",
    "    def method_c(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Method C\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# C inherits from both A and B\n",
    "obj_c = C()\n",
    "obj_c.method_a()  # Output: Method A\n",
    "obj_c.method_b()  # Output: Method B\n",
    "obj_c.method_c()  # Output: Method C\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Multilevel Inheritance: In multilevel inheritance, a subclass inherits from a superclass, and then another subclass inherits from that subclass. This creates a chain of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class A:\n",
    "    def method_a(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Method A\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class B(A):\n",
    "    def method_b(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Method B\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class C(B):  # C inherits from B, which in turn inherits from A\n",
    "    def method_c(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Method C\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# C inherits from both B and A\n",
    "obj_c = C()\n",
    "obj_c.method_a()  # Output: Method A\n",
    "obj_c.method_b()  # Output: Method B\n",
    "obj_c.method_c()  # Output: Method C\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Hierarchical Inheritance: In hierarchical inheritance, multiple subclasses inherit from the same superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def meow(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Cat meows\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dog and Cat both inherit from Animal\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "dog.speak()  # Output: Animal speaks\n",
    "cat.speak()  # Output: Animal speaks\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Hybrid Inheritance: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple types of inheritance. It involves a mix of single, multiple, multilevel, and/or hierarchical inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class A:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class B(A):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class C(A):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
